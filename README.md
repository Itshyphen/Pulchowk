### A DAY IN PULCHOWK

It is a 2D simulation RPG game using C++ and SFML as library.
The game is developed for the academic project of Object Oriented Programming.

#### Dependencies
-  SFML 2.0
 
#### Building Instructions
Compiling is simple in itself, simply compile all the executables within the
/src folder and the main.cpp in the root directory and link the following 
sfml flags with the compiler:\
`-lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system`

##### 1) Windows
You can use CMake if you are on Windows to build the executable through the
CMakeLists file included in the root directory.

##### 2) Linux
If on Linux, use the Makefile to compile and run the program\
`$ make` - to build the program\
`$ make run` - to run the executable\

Additionally, you can refer to the official [SFML documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/) for building files on other platforms.

##### 3) Using CLion IDE (JetBrains)
Open this folder from CLion IDE and run the program. 
The CMakeLists file should be sufficient to build the program.
